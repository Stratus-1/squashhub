# SquashHub — Project Structure, Issue & Fix Log

> **Purpose.** This is the canonical reference for *how the system is wired* and *what has already
> gone wrong and how it was fixed*. Before debugging anything in this project, search this file
> first. If a fix is recorded here, re-apply the recorded approach — do not re-invent it, and do
> not undo it.
>
> **Maintenance rule.** Every time a production issue is diagnosed and fixed, append an entry to
> §4 using the `Symptom → Finding → Fix → Guard` format. Never delete old entries; mark them
> `SUPERSEDED` if a later fix replaces them.

## 1. System overview

| Layer | Tech | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite 5 + TypeScript + Tailwind | SPA, `BrowserRouter`, hosting has built-in SPA fallback |
| Mobile | Capacitor wrapper + PWA | Service worker everywhere except iframes/preview/native |
| Backend | Lovable Cloud (Supabase) | Postgres + RLS, Edge Functions (Deno), Storage, Realtime |
| Payments | Stitch (cards + recurring mandates) | Two **separate** flows — see §3 |
| Messaging | Resend/SMTP email, Twilio WhatsApp, Web Push | `email_send_log`, `whatsapp_send_log` |
| Hardware | Shelly relays (court lights, door access) | GPS geofence gate for door open |

### Core domain rules (never violate)

1. **Single tenancy** — a user belongs to one club. Every query filters by active `club_id`.
2. **Decoupled identity** — `club_members` is the truth for profile data; `profiles` is auth only.
3. **Ladder immutability** — `ladder_position` in `club_members` is the single source of truth;
   migrations/imports never reshuffle it; bulk changes >5 are blocked unless explicitly flagged.
4. **Captain ≠ admin** — captain is league-scoped only; only `role='admin'` grants club admin.
5. **Secrets isolation** — credentials live in the restricted `club_secrets` table, never in
   `clubs` or client code.
6. **League = Association** — interchangeable terms, same entity (`association_id`).
7. **Permanent affiliations** — league numbers in `member_association_affiliations` are never
   deleted, only deactivated.

### Key directories

```
src/pages/            route-level screens (Tournaments, ClubChampsView, LeagueGameDetail, …)
src/components/       feature components; club-admin/ holds admin panels
src/lib/              pure logic: fee-proration, tournament-playoffs, scheduler, stitch-checkout
src/hooks/            use-saas-pricing, use-door-proximity, …
supabase/functions/   Edge Functions (payments, NSA posting, billing, messaging)
docs/                 this file + Android/mobile references
```

---

## 2. Money & billing model (high blast-radius area)

- **Member fees** — categories in `member_fee_categories`; pro-rata joiners handled centrally in
  `src/lib/fee-proration.ts` (rule: joining within one month of renewal rolls into the next season).
- **Ledger** — cash-basis double-entry in `club_journal_entries`; every credit must have legs.
- **Platform SaaS pricing** — graduated sliding scale R6.00 → R2.50 per **active, non-visitor**
  member, R250/month minimum, billed **monthly in advance**. Single source of truth:
  `src/hooks/use-saas-pricing.ts` + `computeTieredCharge`. First platform invoicing date:
  **1 September 2026**. Annual upfront requires a club request + super-admin approval.
- **Trial → invoice** — `run-subscription-billing` issues the first invoice the day after trial end.

## 3. ⚠️ Payments: two separate flows — do not mix

This has caused repeated regressions. They share a provider (Stitch) and *nothing else*.

| | **Once-off / top-up** | **Recurring (mandate)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge functions | `stitch-create-payment`, `stitch-verify-payment` | `stitch-create-mandate`, `stitch-refresh-mandate`, `stitch-reconcile-mandates` |
| Frontend | `src/lib/club-payments.ts` (`startClubCheckout`) | `src/components/PaymentMethodsCard.tsx`, `src/lib/stitch-checkout.ts` |
| Tables | `stitch_payment_sessions`, `stitch_collections` | `stitch_mandates`, `stitch_collections` |
| Return handling | redirect back to `/pay/return` | app tab stays open and **polls** every 4s |

**Standing instruction from the product owner (9 Aug 2026):** when fixing one flow, change only
that flow's files. Do not "harmonise" the other one, and do not refactor a flow that is confirmed
working.

**Hard constraint:** never append query params (e.g. `?redirect_url=`) to hosted
`express.stitch.money` links — Stitch answers **404**. Pass return URLs in the create request body
(`merchantRedirectUrl` + `redirectUrl`), with a bare retry if Stitch rejects unknown keys.

---

## 4. Issue log

Format: **Symptom → Finding → Fix → Guard.** Newest first.

### 2026-08-09 · Top-up "Pay by card" link opened a 404 page
- **Symptom:** member tapped the once-off top-up link and immediately hit Stitch's *Page Not Found*.
- **Finding:** `stitch-create-payment` appended `?redirect_url=…` to the hosted
  `express.stitch.money/pay/{id}` URL. Verified by curl: bare link → 200, with query param → 404.
- **Fix:** redirect URLs moved into the POST body; `appendRedirectUri` now skips
  `express.stitch.money` hosts; retry without redirect fields on a 400.
- **Guard:** memory rule `constraints/stitch-express-links`. Recurring flow untouched.

### 2026-08-09 · Duplicate R10 credit on mandate activation
- **Symptom:** member statement showed two identical R10 credits for one payment.
- **Finding:** the collection webhook posted the credit at 12:15, then mandate activation posted a
  second "first charge" at 12:18.
- **Fix:** removed the duplicate transaction and its journal legs; rewrote
  `record_mandate_initial_payment` to link to an existing Stitch collection instead of posting again.
- **Guard:** idempotency check inside the function; balance reconciled.

### 2026-08-09 · Payers stranded on Stitch's completion page
- **Symptom:** after saving a card, users landed on `express.stitch.money/card-consent/complete`
  and never returned to the app.
- **Finding:** Stitch Express hosted consent/subscribe pages ignore merchant redirect fields.
- **Fix:** mandate setup opens Stitch in a separate tab/Capacitor browser
  (`openStitchMandateWindow`) while the app polls `stitch-refresh-mandate` every 4s and on
  focus/visibility, then closes the window and toasts success.
- **Guard:** 5-minute reconciliation sweep (`stitch-reconcile-mandates`) as backstop.

### 2026-08-08 · First recurring instalment felt like a scam (R20 test charge)
- **Finding:** members hesitated to authorise a token R20.
- **Fix:** `stitch-create-mandate` now collects the full first monthly instalment; reconciliation
  sweep moved to 5-minute intervals.

### 2026-08-08 · Two active mandates per member
- **Fix:** database trigger `enforce_single_active_mandate` — one active mandate per member.

### 2026-08-08 · Subscription due prompt never appeared for club admins
- **Finding:** the invoice query filtered out the `issued` status.
- **Fix:** `SubscriptionDuePrompt.tsx` now includes `issued`.

### 2026-08-08 · Club dashboard member stats failed (unknown column)
- **Finding:** visitor query selected `full_name`; the column is `name`.
- **Fix:** corrected in `ClubStatsCard.tsx`. Stats now count registered visitors *and* shadow
  visitor records created by tournament imports.

### 2026-08-08 · Wi-Fi availability toast never surfaced
- **Finding:** a permanent "seen" flag in `localStorage` suppressed it forever, plus a mobile-only guard.
- **Fix:** daily timestamp key (`.day`) and guard removed in `DashboardWifiCard.tsx`.

### 2026-08-07 · Members missing from filtered member lists
- **Finding:** inconsistent gender values (`male` vs `Men`) excluded rows from filters.
- **Fix:** normalised comparison in `MembersTab.tsx`.

### 2026-08-07 · Pro-rata joiners skipped the next annual renewal invoice
- **Finding:** wrong `season_year` assigned at join time.
- **Fix:** corrected in `src/lib/fee-proration.ts`; joiners now appear in the next renewal batch.

### 2026-08-07 · "Link existing membership" card broken
- **Finding:** `find_unclaimed_memberships()` referenced `slug` where the column is `subdomain`.
- **Fix:** RPC corrected.

### 2026-08-06 · Duplicate member records (Isaac Lambrechts, Nelspruit/Glenwood cases)
- **Finding:** self-registration created a second `club_members` row alongside the imported one.
- **Fix:** cautious SQL merge preserving affiliations/ladder; `LinkExistingMembershipCard.tsx` lets
  users claim a matching record; fuzzy-match warning added to Add Member.
- **Guard:** never delete NSF/NSA affiliations during cleanup.

### 2026-08-06 · Super admin prompted to resume a match he wasn't marking
- **Finding:** `hasScoringProgress` treated any stored session as active.
- **Fix:** tightened the check plus a "spectator gate" in `MatchMarker.tsx`.

### 2026-08-05 · Project monitoring batch (3 findings)
- Players locked out of matches → marker lock release fixed.
- Court re-flow failing → Edge Function error handling corrected.
- Ghost "empty slots" → placeholder cleanup in `SwapFixtureButton.tsx`.

### 2026-08-05 · Non-captains got a raw Edge Function error posting to NSA
- **Fix:** `src/lib/nsa-errors.ts` maps NSA/API failures to human-readable messages in
  `NsaSubmitDialog.tsx`.

### 2026-08-05 · Desktop parity gaps
- Invite cards, open-door tile and sign-out were mobile-only.
- **Fix:** added to `DashboardDesktop.tsx`; sign-out moved into the avatar dropdown in `PageHeader.tsx`.

### 2026-08-05 · "View as player" hid admin functionality for a club captain with admin rights
- **Fix:** impersonation now resolves effective permissions from the impersonated member's roles.

## 5. Five-day audit (5–9 August 2026)

**Data checks run 9 Aug 2026:**

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `stitch_payment_sessions` last 6 days | 1 completed (08 Aug), 2 processing (09 Aug) — the two 404-affected top-up attempts |
| `stitch_mandates` last 6 days | 1 active, 1 cancelled (09 Aug), 1 cancelled (06 Aug — Katya Fulton, never completed at Stitch) |
| `court_reflow_log` last 6 days | 0 rows — no re-flow failures since the fix |
| Duplicate member credits | 1 found and reversed (Daniel Mommsen, R10); balance back to R1 590 |

**Themes observed this week**

1. **Third-party hosted-page assumptions** — Stitch Express ignores redirect params and 404s on
   query strings. Never assume a hosted checkout honours redirects; always have a polling or
   reconciliation backstop.
2. **Double-posting from dual event sources** — webhook *and* poll/refresh both writing ledger
   entries. Every money-writing path must be idempotent against an external reference id.
3. **Column/enum drift** — `full_name` vs `name`, `slug` vs `subdomain`, `male` vs `Men`. Verify
   the actual column/enum values with a query before writing a filter.
4. **Mobile-first drift** — features shipped on mobile layouts only. New dashboard tiles must be
   added to both `Dashboard` (mobile) and `DashboardDesktop`.
5. **Duplicate identities** — imported members re-registering. Always offer a claim/merge path
   rather than creating a second row.

---

## 6. Debug playbook

1. **Reproduce with data first** — `read_query` against the real rows before touching code.
2. **Check the right log** — Edge Function logs for backend, browser console/network for frontend.
3. **Search this file** for the symptom; a recorded fix probably exists.
4. **Fix the category, not the instance** — if one query used the wrong column, grep for siblings.
5. **Verify before declaring done** — re-run the query or the call that showed the failure.
6. **Append to §4.**
