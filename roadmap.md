# Roadmap

## Open
- [ ] Remove Gerhard's conflicting booking while retaining his fixture; restore Nico/Johann's original scheduled slot.
- [ ] Protect scheduled championship allocations from overlapping player bookings; verify targeted regressions.
- [ ] Verify admins cannot bypass occupied-slot protection either.

## Done
- [x] Published 18 Oct 2026: champs-slot fixes (grid display, 35-min reschedule slots, freed old slot), reserved-court 35-min time column, recurring transactions, average-cost fill-in, two-decimal money display, cost-per-tot hint on purchase lines, WhatsApp/SMS switches, Enter Transaction date fix, dialog size fix
- [x] Security scan run before publishing: 30 findings, all previously dismissed by Willem, none unresolved
- [x] Shared grid rows retain every game; four regression tests and signed-in Riverside fictional 35-minute sequence verified, including opening the middle booking
- [x] Court grid shows 35-min champ games on every 45-min row they overlap — verified live on Uitsig Wed 21 Oct
- [x] Reschedule dialog offers the champs' own 35-min slots inside the reserved evening; 45-min club slots stay outside champs times
- [x] Moved champ game leaves its old slot available (hold no longer restored on move) — applied to the backend
- [x] 118 tournament tests pass, types clean, build OK, server engine rebuilt
