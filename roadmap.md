# Roadmap

## Current: CSIR tournament invite extras + build fixes
- [x] Add `invite_extra_details` column to `tournaments`
- [x] Render extras inside auto-generated tournament details block in invites
- [x] Textarea UI in "Invites & messaging" section
- [x] Confirm saving tournament does NOT auto-send emails/invites
- [x] Fix all Supabase Edge Function build errors
- [x] Frontend TypeScript check and production build pass

## Important user constraints
- **Do NOT send out emails automatically** — tournament saves/updates must not trigger email sends. The existing "Send invites now" manual action remains the only send path.

## Backlog
- Bar / POS payment options (mostly complete)
- Visitor open tab for the evening
